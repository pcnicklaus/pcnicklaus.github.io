                        I’m a writer, developer, and aficionado of tomfoolery & shenanigans, both the words and their meanings! One of the the primary reasons I was drawn to web development is that it is true magic. Coding feels like magic; we type these words and symbols and out comes very real and tangible worlds. So yeah, creating something out of nothing makes me feel like a magician and that feels darn good!

                        How do we do this? Good question, we’re developing the methodology, programming and metrics to demonstrate that investing in mental health not only makes sense, but it makes good business sense. We’re going to show that if you (a business owner) invest a dollar in mental health programs and policies, you’ll get back $1.25 of value. So basically if a dollar costs less then a dollar, you buy it, right?!

                    Sigmend is a small start up business that worked to address the issue of mental health. Our first attempt at building an app that would make reporting of moods met with financial resistance, we transitioned to developing methodology, programming and metrics to demonstrate that investing in mental health not only makes sense, but it makes good business sense. From there we then pivoted to creating a OpenLabs which.............

                Galvanize's six month MEAN stack web development program is one of the best in the industry. The program was a truly incredible and intense experience. The time expenditure, class was from 9 to 5 and most evenings and weekends were spent coding, was truly worth it and was made easier by the ridiculously talented staff who made themselves available at nearly any time.

                I've always loved to write, novels and screenplays being my drugs of choice. Ball State creative writing program offered a unique and awesome opportunity due to the partnership with their top 10 in the country telecommunications program that alum David Letterman had invested heavily in. The screenwriting program was one of the few in the nation that would produce several pieces and the process of doing this from the writer's position was really cool and insiteful.

Address Me is a platform where residents can offer to share their mailbox. Those in need can also place a request for a mailbox in the area where it is needed.
