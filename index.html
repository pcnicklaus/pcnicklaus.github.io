                      I’m a writer, developer, aficionado of tomfoolery & shenanigans, both the words and their meanings, and lover of all things printed, especially books, newspapers, and magazines. I think the main reason I fell ridiculously head-over-heels in love with coding is because it is the truest expression and closest I will ever be to magic. When I code, and it works :), it feels like utter and total magic. Or creation, but then people might say I’m comparing myself to a deity, which I am not doing!
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                      But seriously, I get to take a bunch of words and symbols and after hours of debugging and console.logs, a new world appears on a screen. And this world has depth and complexity. And I get to call that "work"… Yay me!! What else, what else… Well as i said, I do love to write and if you’re so inlined, you can checkout my novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Binding-Flow-Patrick-Nicklaus-ebook/dp/B00E5NS3QQ/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1503368443&sr=1-1&keywords=binding+flow" >here.</a>  Or a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaF-Dfd7b44">commercial</a> we did. I did some standup comedy a little while back and i’ve been told there are a quite few gems at the beginning of my <a href="https://twitter.com/pcnicklaus">twitter feed</a> by more then a few people, which made me feel pretty good (and a little cocky until i walked into a sign while thinking about that and almost knocked myself out. Oh fate :). So, yeah, that’s a quick, little skinny on me and thanks for stopping by!

                <h4>Full Stack Developer</h4>
                <p>
                  Worked on a team as a front end developement gig to build a customer, client, and loan officer portals (Angular) for a national insurance agency. Developed a node api that allows remote ordering and service scheduling for a national air conditioning company. Designed and built websites for local businesesses such as a photographer and dog groomer.

                <h4>Chief Hacker</h4>
                <p>
                    Sigmend is a small start up business that is working to address the issue of mental health, specifically, mental illness, which is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Our first attempt at building an app that would make reporting of moods met with financial resistance, so we transitioned to developing methodology, programming, and metrics to demonstrate that investing in mental health not only makes sense, but it makes good financial sense. From there we created outreach events and secured a headline event at Denver Start Up Week. The most recent evolution has been the creation of Open Labs, which brings people with bipolar together to help identify, develop, and share their life hacks, which will lead to resources for both people and business on how to live with and support people who have bipolar.

                    I was the first junior developer hired by Robots and Pencils, an app development consultancy with offices throughout the U.S., Canada and England, which was recognized as being the 34th fasting growing tech company in 2014. My time at R&P was a mainly a stady dose of firehose drinking as I learned and wrote server side code in Rails, Go, and just a bit of Java, along with learning a enough react React to write unit tests and fill in on the occasional component for a front-end project.

                    My time at The Watch Newspapers was one of the most formative experiences in my career.

                Galvanize's six month MEAN stack web development program is one of the best in the industry. The program was a truly incredible and intense experience. The time expenditure, class was from 9 to 5 and most evenings and weekends were spent coding, was truly worth it and was made easier by the ridiculously talented staff who made themselves available at nearly any time.

            <p>
                I've always loved to write, novels, and screenplays being my drugs o' choice. Ball State's creative writing program offered a unique and awesome opportunity due to the partnership with the telecommunications program, which was in the top 10 in the US due generous donations from alumnus, David Letterman. Because of the partnership, the screenwriting program was one of the few in the nation that would actually see their work produced by truly talented students. Being a part of this process from the writer's position provided tons of insight into how the process actually works.
